## TIL (Today I Laearned)
* BFS algorithm
* React Native
* Redux

## To do List 
### July 19, 2019
* Solving BFS algorithm
* Making timer app using React, Redux - Implementing Redux in Our App

## Done List
* I learned data structure deque. Deque(or 2 queue) should be used to solve graph problems with multiple weights.
* I learned how to connect Redux to my project.
```
1. Make reducer.js

2. In reducer.js make Actions, Action creators, Reducer, Reducer Functions

  Action: It is an object. When you want to change state, you have to send Action to Redux store.
  Action creator: It is a function that make action. 
  Reducer : It updates the states depends on Action. It gets 2 parameters which is state and action. 

3. Connect reducer to App. Import reducer and create Store. 
  Provider copies the contents of the store and makes childeren components available for use. 
  
4. mapStateToProps function copies the state of store to props.

5. Dispatch is the function that sends the actions to reducer.
```
Using redux is pretty complex process I think. And the concept is still a little confusing.
