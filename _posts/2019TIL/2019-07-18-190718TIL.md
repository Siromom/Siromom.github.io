## TIL (Today I Laearned)
BFS algorithm

## To do List 
### July 18, 2019
* Solving BFS algorithm
* Making timer app using React, Redux

## Done List
* I practiced how to solve problem using BFS. When I first started studying algorithms, it was really hard to understand. But I think I am getting used to solve problem now. It's important to study step by step.
* Actually I've used Redux before, at the internship program. So today I reviewed Redux. At that time, I don't think I fully understand the concept of Action & Reducer. Today I completely understand it.
  * Action : It is an object. When you want to change state, you have to send Action to Redux store.
  * Reducer : It updates the states depends on Action.
